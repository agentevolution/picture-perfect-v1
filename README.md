## A note on coding style
As far as coding style goes, genesis-child leans more toward [FIG Standards](http://www.php-fig.org/) (with some exceptions) over WordPress coding standards. This is because the majority of popular PHP frameworks and CMS's compyl entirely or more closely to FIG standards. WordPress coding standards seem a little outdated and the spacing between every function call is annoying. It makes more sense to adhere to the PHP community at large. That way you don't have to change the way you code on a per project basis.
